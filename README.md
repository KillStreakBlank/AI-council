# AI Council

An ambitious and probably impossible idea to get many AI to work together on a task using weighted voting based on each AI's abilities.

## Description

AI Council is a collaborative AI system designed to leverage the strengths of multiple advanced AI models, including GPT-4, Codex, Grok, Ollama, Bard, ChatGPT, Watson, and Claude. The goal is to solve complex tasks through structured debates and a weighted voting mechanism, where each AI model contributes based on its specific strengths and expertise. This project aims to harness the collective intelligence of diverse AI technologies to tackle real-world problems more efficiently and effectively.

### Weighted Voting System

The AI Council employs a weighted voting system to ensure that each AI model's contributions are evaluated according to its strengths and weaknesses. By dynamically adjusting the influence of each model based on its historical performance and expertise in relevant areas, the system aims to maximize the strengths and minimize the weaknesses of each AI. This approach fosters a balanced and robust decision-making process.
